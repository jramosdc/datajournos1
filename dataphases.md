The main phases of data insight extraction


. Hypothesis
. Problem evaluation
. Data sources indenfication
. Gathering/Cleaning/Formatting
. Processing
. Outlier, trend extraction
. Real world verification
-------
For hypothesis ideation we need a great deal of real world experience, reporting and good luck!
ie.: Those who migrated outside Spain during the crisis are now returning to main urban areas, increasing the pace of depopulation in the rest of the country.
OR
Messi is the best player of all times.
-------
We have to find what data could be revealing to suppport or discard our hypothesis. Avoid preconceived ideas that can add bias to the analysis. The first case needs a scientific approach in which only a set of metrics will prove our hypothesis. Messi is a case of scoring so we can use whatever measure we deem descriptive of being the best. 
--------
We have now to find the data. This is a sometimes crafty, time consuming process. We have to use oficial and unoficial data. Make sure it is reliable, with the necesary scope and depth.
--------
Cleaning and structuring the data is key to other phases such as visualization, data engine processing, storage, real-time, historical data, etc.
--------
Visualize, statistical processing, train, etc.
--------
Choose the right visual. Find the trends, turning points, curves, plateaus, etc. Find your headline.
